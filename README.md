# AWS Cloud Stack â€” Documentation Only

> This repository is a high-level, sanitized overview of an AWS implementation I built.
> It intentionally contains **no code, no identifiers, and no secrets**.

## Architecture (sanitized)
- CloudFront at the edge (TLS via ACM) in front of S3 (static assets) and Elastic Beanstalk (application).
- IAM (users/roles/policies) for least-privilege access across services.
- Lambda for event-driven operational tasks.
- CodePipeline for CI/CD from GitHub to Elastic Beanstalk.
- CloudFront access logs delivered to S3.

## Operations & Runbooks (samples)
- Investigate traffic spikes or 5xx errors using CloudFront access logs.
- Perform periodic access reviews of IAM roles/policies and adjust scope as needed.
- Safe deployment rollback via Elastic Beanstalk when required.

## Confidentiality
This repo is **documentation-only**. All names, IDs, code, and environment details are intentionally omitted to avoid exposing sensitive or proprietary information.
